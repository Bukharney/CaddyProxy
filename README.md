# Caddy Proxy for My Project

This repository sets up a Caddy reverse proxy for my project. The proxy handles incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests, routes them to the appropriate services, and manages SSL/TLS certificates automatically.

## Features

- **Automatic HTTPS**: Caddy automatically obtains and renews SSL/TLS certificates for your domains using Let's Encrypt.
- **Reverse Proxy**: Forward incoming requests to different services running on your server.
- **Easy Configuration**: Simple, human-readable configuration using the `Caddyfile`.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple backend servers (optional).
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Integrated access and error logs for monitoring traffic and diagnosing issues.

## Prerequisites

- **Caddy**: You need to have Caddy installed on your server. [Installation Guide](https://caddyserver.com/docs/install)
- **Your Project**: Ensure your project is running on one or more backend servers that the proxy will forward traffic to.

## Setup

1. **Clone this repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bukharney/CaddyProxy.git
